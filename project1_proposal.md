Project 1: Proposal

Project Title: 
    Impact of health insurance and prevalence of heart attacks

Team Members: 
    Rebecca Balderas, Elijah Reid, Abdulla Mashaly, and Hannah Doby

Project Description:
    We will investigate the connection between participants’ health insurance by North Carolina county and prevalence of heart disease mortality in North Carolina.  

Research questions to Answer:
    We hope to study the impact of health insurance use and heart disease mortality. We will explore if there is a pattern to having health insurance and cross reference it to heart disease mortality. Our hypothesis is that the availability of health insurance to consumers, the less likely there will be heart disease mortality. 

**is there coorelation between the two data sets?
**does population density affect the number of deaths?
**does population density affect insurance coverage?
**is there an age group with less insurance coverage?
**is there an age group with more deaths?
**what conclusion can we draw from these questions
**Alternative hypothesis: More ppl below poverty line, fewer ppl insured
**null hypothesis: povery does not affect insurance coverage
